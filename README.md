# Statistical Rethinking Course

A goal for the my 2017 summer was to learn Bayesian modelling. This repository serves as a place to put all the follow-along code for later reference and as proof of completion.

All notes and interpretations stem from "Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan" by Richard McElreath. There are separate files for code and notes, yet the code files contain a substantial amount of notes, especially the later chapters.
