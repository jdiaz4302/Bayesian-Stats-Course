#### Grid approximation of the posterior distribution

We can produce the posterior distribution of our model using grid approximation.

#### Sampling from the posterior

In order to learn the most from the posterior, we should sample from it. This is only different from earlier chapters because there are two parameters to sample. 

Once sampled, you can describe the distribution of confidence in each confidence in each combination of mean and standard deviation by summarizing the samples.
