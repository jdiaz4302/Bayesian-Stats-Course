The model is a better fit to the data with a qaudratic; its an even better fit with a cubic. However, a better fit doesn't always translate to a better model

#### Summary

This chapter introduced linear regression; a framework for estimating the association between a predictor and an outcome. The Gaussian distribution is used here to count the relative number of ways that different combinations of mu's and sigma's can produce an observed outcome. MAP is a fitting method that finds and returns the mu-sigma combination that yields maximum posterior probability of producing observed outcomes.

The next chapter will deal with regression models of multiple predictor variables.
